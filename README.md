## Analytics
Yes this version has analytics, but they are fully GPDR-complient, you can read about them [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/analytics)
but TLDR, 
```
Instead of relying on cookies like many analytics products, 
visitors are identified by a hash created from the incoming request. 

Using a generated hash provides a privacy-friendly experience for your visitors 
and means visitors can't be tracked between different days or different websites.
```
